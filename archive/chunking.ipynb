Apart from this, I meet all other eligible criteria for Maternity Leave. Am I eligible for the extended Government-Paid Maternity Leave?\\n\\nAnswer: If your Singapore Citizen child is born on/after 1 January 2017, you\\'ll be eligible for the full 16 weeks Maternity Leave.  If your child is born before 1 January 2017, you are entitled to 12 weeks of Maternity Leave. However, should you marry the child\\'s father within 12 months from the birth of the child, you will be eligible for the remaining extended maternity leave (4 weeks) in that year.\\n\\n\\n\\nQ2: If my baby is born on 1 March and I take the first 8 weeks of Maternity Leave from March to April, can I then take 16 weeks of 50% time work from September to December as Extended Maternity Leave? If yes, how many working days is it equivalent to? \\n\\nAnswer: Subject to management\\'s approval, the last eight weeks (9th to 16th week) of Maternity Leave can be taken flexibly in the manner described within 12 months of the delivery. You should discuss with your supervisor and come to an agreement on the arrangement that will best meet the needs of both parties. 8 weeks of maternity leave is equivalent to 40 working days.\\n\\n\\n\\nQ3: Can an officer who has given birth to her child on a Saturday or Sunday commence her Maternity Leave on the next working day, i.e. Monday? Can an officer who gives birth after office hour on a weekday begin her Maternity Leave the following day? \\n\\nAnswer: Maternity Leave begins either up to 4 weeks before your EDD or on the date of delivery. It does not matter whether delivery takes place during office hours or on a non-working day.\\n\\n\\n\\nQ4: If my child is not a Singapore Citizen at birth (on/after 1 January 2017), and I am I single/unmarried mother, will I still be eligible to the 16 weeks of Maternity Leave? \\n\\nAnswer: If your child was not a Singapore Citizen at birth, Singapore Citizenship must be attained before he reaches 12 months of age for you to be eligible for the full 16 weeks Maternity Leave.\\n\\n\\n\\nQ5: I am an unwed mother. The estimated delivery date of my child was 1 January 2017 but I delivered a week before that. Will I still be eligible for the 16 weeks of Maternity Leave?\\n\\nAnswer: You would be eligible for the 16 weeks of Government-Paid Maternity Leave based on the estimated delivery date (supported by doctor\\'s certification), if your child is a Singapore Citizen.\\n\\n\\n\\nQ6: How is the number of flexible Paternity Leave, Maternity Leave, Adoption Leave days calculated for an officer on part-time employment?\\n\\nAnswer: It will be pro-rated based on the leave entitlement of an officer on full-time employment, using a full-time work week of 42 hours. E.g. If officer works 21 hours a week, he will be entitled to 5 days of Paternity Leave.', metadata={'source': './data/DRAFT 1_Maternity Leave Information.docx'})]"
